# Job Description
We're a well funded team of 12 working on AI frameworks, web3 messaging protocols, a bit of encryption, and fun stuff always on the bleeding edge.
 
If you like being challenged and put to the test, but also value operating in a flexible environment where as long as you do your part, you have complete autonomy and freedom, this position may be for you.
 
We have a globally distributed team and use basecamp as our main tool to limit meetings and stand-ups at weird hours. A typical daily workflow involves ~30min per day catching up on basecamp, diving into deep work, and catching up on basecamp for 30min or less afterwards. 
 
We value privacy, transparency, and open communication. 
 
We move fast, we challenge boundaries, and we have fun doing it. If you're an OG Dev that fits in with our culture fill out this quick 3min typeform https://eijfn1o56i0.typeform.com/to/wSHmuF4I
